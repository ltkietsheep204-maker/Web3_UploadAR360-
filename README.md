# WEBAR - Dragon's Forge

Minimal demo to upload GLB/GLTF models and serve an AR-enabled viewer using `model-viewer`.

## Requirements
- Node.js (16+)

## Install & Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## How to use
- Open `http://localhost:3000` and upload a `.glb` or `.gltf` file (optional audio).
- After upload you get a share URL and QR code.
- Visitors open the URL on a phone; `model-viewer` will enable AR on supported devices.
